Testing notes:
-script = data fetched from index.js
-test = date fetched from testing script



////This data set was on 7-12 and succeeded another completed set from 7-11 which I think was from a 7-9 initializer set

- using the 7-11 initializer backup, the script had 1 more reported comment for Harish than the test. Upon further inspection, it looks like this 1+ stemmed from the initializer itself (it was there on the 7-9 backup). I ran the initializer on 7-12 and the 2 data sets are now equal, so I am assuming a comment from Harish was deleted since then.
- Alexandra 66918724 had 1 more comment in the script than testing, but within the past day she also edited a comment from 7-05, so that does add up. 

civictechindex
- there were no differences in the data set.

public-tree-map
- emillipede had 1 more comment in script. but using the knowledge from the public-tree-map test below (this was done after), I'm assuming that updated comment was recorded in the last completed set so it didn't show up now

food-oasis
- like the test below (this was also done after) there were 4 differences.
- I'm assuming the script picked up tina-moh's comment in the last iteration because it didn't show up here. It was updated on the 10th

////This data set will be built upon from the 7-9 initializer set
Hack for LA website
- same notes from the previous test. Harish and Alexandra had 1 more comment than the testing just like the previous test

civictechindex
-no differences

public-tree-map
-there was only 1 incoming comment even though there are like 4 repos
-emillipede had 1 more comment in the script. This adds up because the one comment that came in was an update from a comment on 7-09.

food-oasis
-there were 4 differences in data, but they look like the results from an ordering difference that resulted from a change in contribution count
-tina-moh has 1 more comment in script, which checks out because she did update a comment from 7-08
- timmal, jp, and lvl3jose were all in different orders because of some updated comments. after doing the work on paper, it added up.
